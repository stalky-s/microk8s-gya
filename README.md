This repository contains a beginner-friendly guide to deploying and managing Kubernetes clusters using MicroK8s. The tutorial walks through setting up a local development environment, deploying applications, and exploring Kubernetes features such as networking, storage, and scaling. This is my first repo so any positive critique is welcomed :)
